We are passionate developers and designers from Montevideo willing to document our expertise about the web, code, design and overall experiences.

Our goal is to be able to share our experience on top notch technologies, experiences and designs.

We enjoy working with Ruby (rack, sinatra, rails), Javascript (requirejs, dojo, jquery), SQL/noSQL (postgres, mysql, redis), standards compliant HTML/CSS (sass, less), Python (flask, pyramid, django) but we're always looking for new challenges.

Friends and code, what more can a developer ask for?
